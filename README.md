## Description

My motivation for this project was to understand the components to coding and better myself in the ways of coding. This project was built to better understand how the makeup of a website works and to help bootcamp students better understand the different areas of coding there are to be discovered. This project was also created so there is a platform for students to have when needing to study for the bootcamp. The project itself helped me understand the beginning stages of coding, navigate through my device, and to learn about Github.
